Data science roles have recently been in high demand across various industries across the world. Glassdoor, one of the popular job listing platforms published a dataset containing different data-related jobs in the USA.

The primary aim of this project is to use these listings to offer assistance to individuals who are either looking to transition into the field of data or are already established within it, in the USA. The objectives of this project include:

Identifying the most in-demand data-related roles.
Determining the technological skills required for different data-related positions.
Analyzing the distribution of salaries among various data-related jobs.
Identifying the sectors that prominently seek professionals with data expertise.
Pinpointing the top locations associated with each specific data-related role.

### Dataset
This project utilized a dataset sourced from KAGGLE, which showcases listings for a variety of data-related job postings on Glassdoor. The analysis was conducted using Python, mainly for data cleaning and initial transformations. Additional data transformations were carried out using Microsoft Excel, while Power BI was employed for visualization purposes.
